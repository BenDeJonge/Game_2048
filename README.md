# Game_2048
Simple Python implementation of the 2048 game.
Press the arrow keys to move blocks around. Every move, a new block spawns and neighboring blocks of equal value are added up.
You win if you reach a block of value 2048. You lose if the whole board is filled and no legal moves remain.

## 2048.py
The main game logic.

## colors.py
A settings file containing fonts and colors, mimicking the lay-out of the original.

## 2048_ai.py
TODO: If I find the time, I might implement a Monte-Carlo Tree Search based AI for this game later on.
